# Define virtual services here that shall be exposed to the world through DNAT.
#
# src-zone is the zone where traffic will come from.

# ext-addr:ext-service describe the address that our clients are connecting to.
# int-addr:int-service describe the address where they'll be sent.
#
# If int-addr is "DOCKER", then we'll rely on Docker creating the correct
# routing rules itself, and only make sure we're not blocking related traffic.
