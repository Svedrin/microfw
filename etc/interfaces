# List of interfaces, the zone they belong to, and protocols that should be
# allowed in addition to what's defined in the rules file.
#
# Note that protocols listed here will only be allowed to talk to the Firewall
# itself, thus enabling VPN and routing protocols. They will not be allowed to
# pass through the Firewall to other networks.
#
# If you need multiple protocols on a single interface, separate them by commas.
#
# If you're running docker, be sure to add all docker-managed bridges to a special
# zone named DOCKER. Existance of this zone will switch MicroFW into Docker mode,
# which makes sure that MicroFW and Docker integrate cleanly.
