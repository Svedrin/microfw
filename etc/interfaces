# allowed in addition to what's defined in the rules file.

# Note that protocols listed here will only be allowed to talk to the Firewall
# itself, thus enabling VPN and routing protocols. They will not be allowed to
# pass through the Firewall to other networks.

# If you need multiple protocols on a single interface, separate them by commas.
